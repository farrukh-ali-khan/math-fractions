# math-fractions

`Math-Fractions` is a simple Python project designed to help learners **understand fractions visually and mathematically**. It includes three main functionalities:

## 1. Draw a Fraction (`draw_fraction.py`)

- Input a numerator and denominator (e.g., `1/4`)
- Draw a circle divided into equal parts using **Turtle graphics**
- Shade the parts according to the fraction, making fractions **easy to visualize**

## 2. Compare Fractions (`compare_fractions.py`)

- Input two fractions (e.g., `1/2` and `3/4`)
- Compare which fraction is larger using **decimal conversion**
- Prints the result in a **readable format**

## 3. Add Fractions (`add_fractions.py`)

- Add two fractions with the same denominator
- Display the result, including **mixed numbers** if needed
- Automatically **simplifies fractions** when possible

## Key Features

- **Visual representation of fractions**
- **Simple and clear comparison** of two fractions
- **Automatic fraction addition and simplification**
- **Beginner-friendly Python scripts**
- Great for **homework, tutorials, or personal learning projects**
